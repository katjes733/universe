T-Invadr.3ds

What you have just unzipped is Empire's newest fighter for use against the
Rebellion.  Called the Tie-Invader, it is the missing link between the Tie-
Bomber and the Tie-Interceptor.  With the speed and manuverablility of the
Tie-Interceptor, and the Warhead launchers like the Tie-Bomber on each wing
point, the Invader is one of the deadlyest methods of torpedo delivery to
enemy capital ships.
